A man has wanted to be a scientist his whole life. He spent years developing the mannerisms, speech patterns and wardrobe of an eccentric genius. He gets a job interview but forgot to learn one thing, science.

The interviewer looked up from his desk at the man sitting across from him, did a slight double take, then returned to his notes. 

The applicant, one Dr Ainderby Quernhow, had arrived wearing a dirty T-shirt, what appeared to be ten day old boxer short underpants and a rather dishevelled pink bathrobe with pens in the breast pocket. His hair clearly hadn't seen a pair of scissors in months and to cap it all he was wearing fluffy bunny slippers. 

In short, he was the perfect candidate. He, Carl Gibbons, was going to get him on board no matter what.

However, there was a problem: the job wasn't real. It was all part of an elaborate set up by reality TV show "You've Been Zocked" where participants think they're getting a dream job only to have it all revealed as a fake by the infamous Dr Zock. If the show was getting good ratings this dream job could last weeks building to a superb final episode which was always pure comedic gold. The upcoming show called for "an eccentric science genius given the chance to run a lab in a sci-fi film". The problem the interviewer faced was how to get the highly qualified Dr Quernhow to accept the job and not suspect it was entirely fake.

Ainderby Quernhow sat across from the interviewer and felt the familiar tension rise up. He was a total fraud and he knew it. Ever since he was a small boy he had been obsessed with science. He'd set up a small laboratory in his bedroom and mixed up a few chemicals in test tubes. Stink bombs were a particular specialty at the time. His parents had bought him a white lab coat (a few sized too large at first, but he grew into and then out of it). Whenever he'd talked to grown ups about his latest experiments they'd been really impressed and called him a little genius. So he'd let his hair grow long and unkempt. More positive feedback about his abilities. He started wearing tweed and reading Scientific American. Before long people were referring to him in conversations as "that nerdy science guy" and he basked in his perceived glory. He'd made it in science and nobody knew he didn't have a single qualification to his name. One day he added "Dr" to his name on a credit card application just for fun. To his surprise, and satisfaction, he was approved. Soon he began to believe he could science with the best of them and so he applied for the job of "Head of Research for Grock Industries" and here he was.

"Thank you for coming in today, Dr Quernhow. We appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule." Ainderby snapped back from his reverie and into the present moment.

"Nnnnyes. I'm quite, quite happy to be here in your marvellous company." Maybe he'd laid it on a bit thick, but he could ease back later if he needed to.

"OK... Now are you familiar with the current research by Grock Industries?"

"Nnnnnoo. Not as such. No. Although... no." This was the performance of his life.

"Well, much of it has to do with quantum computing. A bit above my head to be honest, but I have a list of questions that the research team assures me should help with identifying the right person for the job. So question one..."

Ainderby felt his palms turn slick with sweat. His heart began to race. His armpits felt tight, even in the pink bathrobe (always a convincer). How on earth was he going to be able to answer a question on quantum computing? 

"Given an asystolic defibrilating convectogram how would you construct a partial Einstein bridge?"

Wait, what? Was this interviewer for real? Even Ainderby with his total lack of formal science education could see right through that question. He'd seen Sliders so he knew Rosen was involved. Was the interviewer just teasing him? Was it some kind of joke? Was there a camera in the back of the chair recording all this? Hang on, thought Ainderby, Grock sounds a lot like Zock - that reality TV show - there's an opportunity here...

"Nnnnnyes. Clearly the question refers to an Einstein-Rosen bridge which does have a role in quantum mechanical treatment of computing. I'm frankly surprised that your team would have made such an elementary error." Let's see where he goes with that.

Carl breathed a sigh of relief. The guy wasn't a fraud. He was the real deal. And a total pompous ass at that. Taking this social reject down a peg or two in the show would give him a sense of personal satisfaction. Time for some fake cameraderie.

"Hah, hah. You got me Dr Quernhow. We always put in what we call a 'filter question' to weed out the lesser candidates quickly. Let me get on to the real questions. So, Dr Quernhow, could you explain in basic terms how a quantum computer works."

"Nnnnnyes. That would be quantum superposition and entanglement working to perform computational operations." Fortunately, he had read a feature on the recent work by the D-Wave company on Reddit yesterday so he was pretty sure that was correct. Never go into details, he reminded himself, that way you stay smart.

"If you say so, Dr Quernhow." Ainderby could see that Carl had fallen for his science guy act hook, line and copy of Scientific American. The only way he could have convinced a professional interviewer this quickly was if the whole thing was entirely fake. His Grock/Zock theory was right after all. That meant that he could pretty much say anything he liked and the more outlandish he was the more the ratings would climb. And then, when the inevitable unmasking of his own fraudulent past came out it would be a double whammy for the show. There would be so much publicity that he would get his fifteen minutes of fame, and likely a small fortune in appearance fees and then be quickly forgotten.

Carl stood up and walked around the desk to face Ainderby. He leaned back against his desk and said conspiratorially, "You know, Dr Quernhow, I don't normally tell this to prospective candidates, but I think you're just the man for the job." He offered his hand.

Ainderby rose and shook Carl's proffered hand. 

"Nnnnnyes. I think I quite agree with your proposal." He was going to have an absolute ball with these guys.
