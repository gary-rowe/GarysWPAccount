[WP] The world is not, and has never been what it seems. The truth is so dark and horrid it can drive whomever knows it, including our narrator, mad. No Lovecraftian stuff

I am compelled to tell my tale. 

*Hee hee. No one will believe you. No one will believe you.*

Years ago I was asked by my country to visit Antarctica on a scientific mission. It was a straightforward show of interest in and support for the recent findings of some prominent European scientists.

*Their souls tasted so good. I licked their minds clean.*

I was taken to a basic office which concealed a deep elevator shaft. We travelled down so far it began to get uncomfortably hot in my suit. When the doors opened I was relieved to feel a fresh air-conditioned breeze on my face. More humid than I'd have expected.

*I smelled your dignity when you entered my space.*

I recall a narrow corridor which opened into a colossal cavern the like of which I had never before witnessed. It was so large that its scale dwarfed imagination. I could see an underground sea, and what appeared to be an underground sun illuminating a far distant horizon.

*My space. My twisted space. Only a small price to pay to see it.*

My companion, a young man by the name of Nigel Aldershot, explained that they had been performing geophysical operations in the region when the instruments started to show certain anomalies. Suspecting problems with the equipment they recalibrated and carefully tested but the results came back the same. Somehow there was a vast space, far too large to be a natural occurance, three miles below the ice. After convincing their sponsors that it was worth investigating the military became involved and the project became shrouded in secrecy.

*Sssss. I am Gaia's parasite and you thought me pretty.*

Apparently the European team had ventured out over the sea but had not had sufficient fuel to reach the far side so turned back with plans to prepare a larger mission. I gave my team permission to assist them and after a week or so of preparation we were confident that we would make it to the horizon and return within a day.

*Clever of you to stay behind. You made me wait.*

Well, what happened next is well documented, although still rightly shrouded in secrecy. If the public ever found out what lay beyond that horizon creating that second sun there would be mass suicides overnight. The European team returned, but they were not the same people that left. With the exception of one man, Nigel, my guide from earlier, they were all catatonic. They simpled stared at the second sun on the horizon that never set. Even when we got them into the medical tents, they still turned to face it. 

*No-one can gaze upon my beauty and forget me. I leave my mark.*

I asked Nigel what had happened and I will never forget his words.
