"Ever heard of The Continental, Ted?"

I clicked my pen and looked up from my desk. Harald, one of our customers from Moonlight Extraction, was standing over me looking a little sweaty. I shook my head and reached into my desk drawer to retrieve an order form. I looked up and Harald was gone. That was weird. Normally he'd stay and have a chat. I wonder if it had anything to do with that order we'd screwed up last week. I'd heard that Harald got into a lot of trouble over the invoice. Still, yesterday's paperwork beckoned and just as I was getting into it the phone rang.

"Valhalla Furniture Delivery. Ted here. How can I help?"

"Ted? I didn't think you'd be in today," said Ragnar, one of our best customers.

"Why not?"

"Oh, er, just thought you'd be taking some time out to, um, burn the candle at both ends."

"What? It's ten thirty in the morning." Today was getting just bizarre. First Harald and now Ragnar.

"Never mind. Can you arrange delivery of a dozen mead hall tables for next week? You're not gonna do a Harald on me though, right?"

I took the order and hung up. Make one little mistake on an invoice and it's just grist for the gossip mill.

I work in the Accounts department of Valhalla Furniture Delivery. It's a great company with great people. Eric was an excellent driver, always on time, and Bjorn, our customer relations guy, was never off sick. Except for today which was why the call from Ragnar had come through to me. I guess the paperwork was going to have to wait.

The phone rang again.

"Ted here. How can I help?"

"Hey Ted, it's Sweyn. Bad news about Moonlight Extraction. You might say it all went chicken legged."

"Did you just say 'chicken legged'? Never heard that before. Something off 4chan?"

"Um, yeah, that's right. Listen, can you send out 50 Neverfail Flaming Torches real quick?"

"Sure, Sweyn. Why the rush?"

"Oh, no particular reason. Wouldn't want you, I mean, them, to be, er, late."

And so the long day wore on. Endless calls from customers hoping to get orders in quick and by closing time I had quite a pile on my desk. All good for business I thought as I placed the phone down for the last time.

At that moment Ragnarok began. The front door burst open and I caught a glimpse of a man in a suit wielding two semi-automatic pistols with deadly efficiency. In seconds three of my co-workers were lying on the floor in desperate need of medical attention while others were fleeing for the fire escape. The man didn't even break his stride as he lay waste to all before him. I stood up.

"Who are you?" I asked.

"My name is John Wick. Some call me Baba Yaga. I'm here for Ted in Accounting."

I sighed. Suddenly it all made sense.

"That'll be me. Reason?"

"100 gold reasons. Someone wants you gone real bad." John raised his guns and fired.

In that moment time seemed to slow down as it always did when my death was imminent. I had time to notice every detail of my surroundings. I could see the hammers coming down into the firing chambers of the twin Heckler and Koch P30Ls. The soft puff of air pushing aside the smoke as the rounds started to make their way down the barrels. 

I knew I had fractions of a second to finish this. I calmly reached down on to my desk and retrieved my red stapler. I'd always appreciated its heft but never more than today. By the time it reached John Wicks' head it was supersonic.

Poor John. He never really had a chance.

I stepped around the desk and listened as the bullets thwacked into my leather chair. Time was back to normal so the threat was over. I stood over the headless remains of John Wick.

"Mr Wick. You may have killed The Boogeyman, but you just don't mess with Accounting."
