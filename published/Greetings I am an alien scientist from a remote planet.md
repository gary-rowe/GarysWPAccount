Eric was mightily bored. Day after day just sitting next to the automated radio telescope waiting for a repeat of the
"WOW!" signal was hardly stimulating. He didn't notice the red light flashing. He did notice the klaxon blaring as the
computers completed the signal analysis and concluded that this input qualified for the "OMFGIAF!" (Oh My Fudging 
Gosh I Am Famous - or similar) category.

Quickly Eric reached over to turn off the damn klaxon and then swivelled to pull the big red book of procedures from 
its place on the bookcase. Without skipping a beat he notified the relevant authorities to get confirmation of the 
signal and was quickly assured that the computer had correctly classified the signal. In fact, the signal itself was 
remarkably straightforward to decode. It began with a prime number sequence then quickly built into a mathematical 
framework that demonstrated a structured language based on US English as used on the Reddit website:

*Greetings! I am an alien scientist from a remote planet in the Andromeda Galaxy. AMA!*

Scientists were dumbfounded. There was absolutely no doubt that this signal originated in the Andromeda galaxy. 
Multiple tracking stations had confirmed this over and over. Everything in the signal was consistent with 
inter-galactic communication requirements. It had to be genuine.
 
The world was in shock. Religions based on the non-existence of life on other planets were abandoned overnight. World
 leaders gathered to debate what the first question should be. A global vote was held so that everyone could 
 feel involved and after the winner "Should we call you Alien McAlienFace?" was rejected, an enclave of top scientists 
 decided that the better question should be:
 
*How can we communicate using faster than light technology?*
 
After sending the message through a focused array of all the world's radio telescopes the scientists leaned back and 
congratulated themselves. They only had to wait for 2.57 million years to get an answer.
