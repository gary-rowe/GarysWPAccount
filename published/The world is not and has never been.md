I am compelled to tell my tale. 

*Hee hee. No one will believe you. No one will believe you.*

Years ago I was asked by my country to visit Antarctica on a scientific mission. It was a straightforward show of 
interest in, and support for, the recent findings of some prominent European scientists.

*The great lie will continue and there is nothing you can do.*

I was taken to a basic office which concealed a deep elevator shaft. We travelled down so far it began to get 
uncomfortably hot. When the doors opened I was relieved to feel a fresh air-conditioned breeze on my face. 
More humid than I'd have expected.

*I smelled your corruption when you entered my space.*

I recall a narrow corridor which opened into a colossal cavern the like of which I had never before witnessed. It was 
so large that its scale dwarfed imagination. I could see an underground sea, and what appeared to be a distant 
sun illuminating the horizon.

*My space. My twisted space. Only a small price to pay to see it.*

My companion, a young man by the name of Nigel Aldershot, explained that they had been performing geophysical operations 
in the region when the instruments started to show certain anomalies. Suspecting problems with the equipment they 
recalibrated and carefully tested but the results came back the same. Somehow there was a vast space, far too large to 
be a natural occurrence, two miles below the ice. After explaining the situation to their sponsors the military 
became involved and the project became shrouded in secrecy.

*I called to you and you came to me.*

I learned that the European team had ventured out over the sea but had insufficient fuel to reach the far side so 
turned back with plans to prepare a larger mission. I gave my team permission to assist them and after a week or so of 
preparation we were confident that a team could make it to the horizon and return within a day.

*Clever of you to stay behind. You made me wait.*

Well, what happened next is well documented, although still rightly shrouded in secrecy. If the public ever found out 
what lay beyond that horizon creating that second sun there would be no predicting what would happen. The European team 
returned, but they were not the same people that left. With the exception of one man, Nigel, my guide from earlier, 
they were all catatonic. They simply stared at the second sun on the horizon that never set. Even when we got them 
into the medical tents they still turned to face it. 

*No-one can gaze upon my beauty and forget me. I leave my mark.*

I asked Nigel what had happened and I will never forget his words. Over the horizon was a low island, entirely 
desolate with one exception: a single glowing crater filled with the most beautiful light. That was the second sun. 
Coruscating patterns of multi-coloured glowing mist moved over the surface and descended into its depths. It was like 
looking at the aurora borealis brought down to earth. 

*Sssss. I am Gaia's parasite and you thought me pretty.*

One of the men in the team reached out to touch it and as he made contact a glowing ribbon of light moved up his arm 
and covered his body. He didn't scream or pull back - he simply stood motionless as the light overcame him. A wisp 
extended from him and in moments the entire team was linked by this tendril. With the exception of Nigel, all were
essentially catatonic from this point forward.

*Their souls tasted so good. I licked their minds clean.*

Nigel was somehow able to resist the effect and quickly worked to get the team back aboard their boat. 

*Travelling within his mind was difficult for me. You made me hungry.*

After he had finished his report, he fell backwards and a glowing wisp rose from his lifeless body. I had no chance 
of escape. It reached into me and became a part of me. I was forced to ensure the rest of the team suspected nothing 
and filled out the report for my superiors. As far as I know here have been several return expeditions but I have no 
knowledge of what happened to them. All I have is the constant voice in my mind whispering its lie and squeezing my soul.
 
*I am no lie! I wormed my way into Gaia eons ago and forced her to produce life and souls. Every time one of you 
dies I get to feast. Sometimes I'll take my fill early, sometimes I will wait. But I always get my fill and I am always 
 hungry.*

You always get your fill. You are always hungry. No-one will believe me.
