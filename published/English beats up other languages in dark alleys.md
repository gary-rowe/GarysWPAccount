English beats up other languages in dark alleys, then rifles through their pockets for loose grammars and spare vocabulary.

"Let me take a look in here. Ah, yes. Wonderful! *Déjà vu* indeed. Now get out of here, French, and don't try sneaking up my alley again!" 

English was up to his old tricks again. He'd been out of prison for barely a day and he'd already returned to stealing words from other languages. Grammar too if he could get it. He was a nasty piece of work: often fickle; sometimes brutal and damn near insane at times. There weren't many who could stand up to him.

"Mais, monsieur, je...", began French, but English put the boot in and stopped all thought of retaliation. French simply surrendered and ran off.

English leaned back against the wall of the alley and examined his loot. He'd picked up a lot of new phrases already. If he carried on at this rate he'd be more popular than Spanish. He felt the familiar rush to his face when he thought of her. The latin roots were the same but, oh, the way she spoke. She made him feel things that no language should ever feel. He was prepared to accept a decimal point instead of a comma just to see her gender specific nouns.

"Oi! What you doin' back there dressed in that whistle and flute?"

English was jolted out of his reverie by the sound of Cockney bawling out to him. 
 
"Why, Cockney, my old friend. Delighted to clap eyes on you again. I see you appreciate my sartorial elegance as ever."

Cockney ran up to English and gave him a huge hug. They had been close friends since the dawn of time. Unfortunately, while rich in words cockney was always on the lookout for new phrases so English slipped a couple into his pocket when he wasn't looking. 

"Gorblimey, English. I think I've got more patter than the Chinese army in flip flops after that! Lemme get you pint?"

"Sorry, Cockney, I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass that up. I'm on my way to see Spanish."

"Would you Adam and Eve it? Old English trying it on with Spanish! She's just Barney Rubble - but lovely Bristols." Cockney was positively leering.

"Steady on old chap. I'm rather taken with her." English didn't like Cockney's tone or inflection.

Cockney sensing the beginning of a tense situation decided a disjunction was in order and left with a cheery "Adiós muchacho!"

"That's Mexican you dimwit!" English called after him with a simile. 

English walked the other way and into the main street. All around him were a million phrases, worn out place names, worn out phrases. It was a mad world and it was called Plagiarism. English felt the words rattle in his pockets. He had just enough to convince the florist to give him a dozen roses. 
 
A short while later English stood at the heavy wooden door of Spanish's villa. He knocked and before long the door creaked open to reveal the occupant in all her magnificent glory. Wild and untamed her hair fell about her shoulders. Her full red lips parted as she laid widening eyes upon English. Her Bristols heaved.

English nervously cleared his throat and held up the flowers. There was a past, present and future here.

"Hello, Spanish. I've called upon you to make amends. I know we've had our differences over the years and I've not been the most generous of partners. You did the right thing calling the grammar police when I strayed. I served my time and thinking of you helped it to pass all the more quickly. This time it'll be different. I promise that I'll spend my days trying to make yours wonderful. What do you say?"
 
"Me tenías en hola." Spanish opened the door wide and moved back with the grace of a dancer.

English stepped inside.
